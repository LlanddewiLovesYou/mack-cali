          decades, Roseland, a subsidiary of Mack-Cali, has played an integral
          role in the creation of the Port Imperial neighborhood, and the
          revitalization of the Hudson River waterfront in Weehawken and
          West New York. As part of a $2-billion, 200-acre master-planned
          development, Roseland has brought more than 2,600 apartments to
          market at Port Imperial, and has more than 2,000 apartments in
          the pipeline.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Now is the opportunity to elevate Port Imperialâ€™s profile as a
          premier destination for renters who value the rare combination
          of luxury living, dining and retail, world-class views of Manhattan,
          convenient transportation access, and open space that is difficult
          to find in the New York Metropolitan Area.
